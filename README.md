This is an application for a company offering online nanny services. Using
Firebase Realtime Database, I have implemented user authentication, allowing for
registration, login, retrieving current user data, and logout functionality. The
nanny collection is also created in the Realtime Database, which serves as the
backend for my project.

The application features pagination, initially displaying four nanny profiles,
with the option to load more as needed. Clicking on the "Read more" button opens
a detailed card showcasing the nanny's information, experience, and reviews from
parents.

Filtering options are included to sort nannies by experience level, age range of
children they can care for, and hourly rates. Authorized users can add nannies
to their favorites, which can be viewed on a dedicated favorites page; this
option is not available to unauthorized users. Additionally, forms for
registration, login, and scheduling a trial lesson are presented in modal
windows. The layout is responsive, accommodating screen sizes from 320px to
1440px, and is optimized for mobile and tablet devices.
